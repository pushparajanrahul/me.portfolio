          I Publiced one papers in the International Journal of Enhanced Research in Science Technology & Engineering.
          - [Wireless Automation of Multi-process using Labview](https://www.erpublications.com/uploaded_files/download/download_03_02_2014_05_58_19.pdf)
          - The Project focuses about the wireless automation of multiple process using Labview. The wireless system interface with the PC using DAQ card. According to the process variable received through DAQ,
            Labview generates controlling signal based on the logic implemented in it. Multi process multi-controlling scheme can be implemented so that the user can choose the controlling action as per requirements.
            The controlling signal is feedbacked using DAQ and transmitted back wireless to control the final control
            element. In this project we monitor and control tank level wirelessly using Labview and another process of simple pick and place robot using stepper motor.
