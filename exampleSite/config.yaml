    content: |-
      My journey in Machine Learning Engineering spans across various domains of supervised and unsupervised learning.
      
      Through this portfolio, I'm sharing key projects and experiences that reflect my work with computer vision tasks - from binary classification using CNN architectures to more complex image analysis involving localization and segmentation using state-of-the-art models and more.
      
      In the realm of natural language processing, my work involves leveraging pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) through direct prompting and in-context learning approaches for enhanced label generation and task performance.
      
      The portfolio also showcases projects involving matching algorithms, ranking systems, and low-rank adaptation techniques for model fine-tuning. Additionally, I've worked on recommendation systems and explored multimodal learning approaches that bridge different data modalities.
      
      Through these projects and my published blog articles, I aim to share insights from my ongoing exploration in the field of machine learning engineering.

          - [Wireless Automation of Multi-process using Labview](https://www.erpublications.com/uploaded_files/download/download_03_02_2014_05_58_19.pdf)
          - The Project focuses about the wireless automation of multiple process using Labview. The wireless system interface with the PC using DAQ card. According to the process variable received through DAQ,
            Labview generates controlling signal based on the logic implemented in it. Multi process multi-controlling scheme can be implemented so that the user can choose the controlling action as per requirements.
            The controlling signal(feedback signal) is received using DAQ and transmitted back wireless to control the final control
            element. In this project we monitor and control the tank level through wireless communication (Zigbee Protocol) using Labview and another process of simple pick and place robot using stepper motor.
